        <p>Years ago I wrote short stories. For many of these I now look back and cringe. For this question, I suspect I shall look back at it similarly. However I think it's important to record this otherwise I'll have nothing to look back on, which is worse.</p>
<p>As is often the case when I am in Germany, the topic of (painful) train travel came up, and in particular: is it quicker to go North↔South or East↔West? Me being me, I wondered if I could answer this with data.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>The TLDR is: maaaaaaybe. You can see the <a href="/notebooks/questions/de_nsew_travel/2025-12-26.html">notebook</a> for more detail on where I got to, but my approach was, in summary:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find all cities in Germany.</li>
<li>Create all pairs of cities that traverse a North↔South or East↔West boundary.</li>
<li>Find shortest travel time between these cities.</li>
<li>Compute speed by dividing travel time by crow-flies distance between cities.</li>
<li>Group routes into North↔South or East↔West and plot a distribution.</li>
</ol>
<p>The overall outcome can be seen in the image at top: there doesn't seem to be an obvious difference. I could be more rigorous about this by doing a statistical test, but I think there are bigger issues to deal with.</p>
<p>As is often the case, doing an initial investigation just reveals problems with the definition of the question 😀. For example, if I look at the distribution of crow-fly distances, by normalising to speed, am I ignoring something of interest?</p>
<figure class="image">
    <img src="&#x2F;images&#x2F;crow_flies_km.png" />
</figure><br />
<p>Is it maybe that East↔West journeys are generally longer than North↔South? Perhaps not. If you look at the map of cities you can see there is a cluster of cities near the North↔South boundary.</p>

</figure><br />
<p>This will introduce a bias in that it will produce a bunch of routes that are short.</p>
<p>There is also the issue that I am (arbitrarily) choosing 9am on 10th Jan 2026 as the departure time.</p>
<p>I only wanted to spend a day on this, so I won't take this further for now. However, if I did, I'd probably want to instead do <em>something</em> like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prepare:
<ol>
<li>Take the area of Germany and subdivide it into areas using <a href="https://h3geo.org">H3</a> or <a href="https://a5geo.org">A5</a> cells.</li>
<li>Use the centroid of each of these to categorise them into quadrants.</li>
<li>Find all pairs as before, but this time between centroids of these areas.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Collect: for each pair, for 24h throughout the day, in 1h steps, find fastest travel time.</li>
<li>Analyse:
<ul>
<li>Do something like before but, since there may still be bias from how often routes of different lengths occur between areas, I probably want to bucket by route length and compute an average.</li>
<li>This will give me more of an unbiased summary. However, since population distribution isn't unbiased, I probably want to rebias the sample by wieghting towards where more people live. This gives more of an idea of what a typical experience would be like.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyways, I'm not gonna do all that now 😀.</p>
<p>One thing I <em>will</em> probably do sooner is re-use the <a href="https://github.com/motis-project/motis">motis server setup</a>. It was a massive pain trying out many public/private libraries/services for travel times, and finding various versions of broken-ness or "please talk to sales" road-blocks.</p>
<p>Motis worked really well out-of-the-box and could easily handle all of Germany on my Macbook Air; only took about 20 minutes to import the data, and then lookups were fast. Also, even though I was using it for API only, the nice UI for inspecting / debugging was a great bonus.</p>
<figure class="image">
    <img src="&#x2F;images&#x2F;motis.png" />

<p>Even better, it's based on open-data for <a href="https://download.geofabrik.de/europe/germany.html">Maps</a> and <a href="https://gtfs.de">Timetables</a>!</p>
