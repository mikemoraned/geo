# Rust Rules

These rules **extend** the [Rust API Guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/checklist.html) and the [Microsoft Pragmatic Rust Guidelines](https://microsoft.github.io/rust-guidelines/) — the canonical baselines for naming (`C-CASE`, the `as_`/`to_`/`into_` conversions), trait derivation, and API design. What follows is our **additions, emphases, and deliberate deviations**, not a full restatement; where a rule mirrors a named guideline it cites the `C-*` code.

- Follow [Rust doc guidelines](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rustdoc/write-documentation/what-to-include.html) if comments are needed
- **Comments describe long-lived properties of the code, not the workflow that produced it.** Apply this test to every candidate comment: *would it still read correctly to a stranger if every caller, every input value, every motivating task, and every surrounding circumstance changed?* Only the function's own contract and invariants survive that test — everything else is leakage and will rot the moment work moves on. The principle is the test, not a list. Things that typically fail it: slice/phase/PR/task references, "previously did X, now does Y" framing, the calling site that motivated the change, and current snapshots of inputs (specific counts, specific file paths a caller happens to use today, the current default of a flag, the current name of a model). Describe the contract in terms of the parameters, not the values they hold this week. If the only honest justification is "the current task needs this," it belongs in the task/slice doc, not the code.

- **Prefer adding a battle-tested dependency over hand-rolling non-trivial logic.** Datetimes, RNG, statistics, ML metrics, parsers — if a published crate solves it, take the dep.
  - Default to the dep even when the standard-library or hand-rolled version "looks short". Bespoke code accumulates: it needs tests, edge-case handling, and ongoing maintenance.
  - Before claiming a library doesn't support what you need, check the *latest* version's docs (the API may have changed since older releases). State the version you checked.
  - Hand-rolling is acceptable only for genuinely application-specific logic (e.g. domain enums, business rules) — not for replicable algorithms like ROC-AUC, train/test split, or seeded shuffling.
- When multiple crates share a dependency, pull it to workspace-level `[workspace.dependencies]`
- Always use latest stable Rust version and edition; do not use nightly
  - Specify version in `rust-toolchain.toml` and edition in `Cargo.toml`

- Always remove dead code — never suppress warnings with `#[allow(dead_code)]` to keep code "for later". Git history is the archive; the working tree should only contain what's currently used.
- Prefer an explicit `Result` with a `thiserror` error over a panic. Reserve `unwrap()`/`expect()` for cases that are genuinely infallible by construction (a compile-time constant, a just-checked invariant) or where panicking is the intended behaviour (build scripts, a once-per-process startup install); annotate those with a justification of why it can't fail. When replacing an `expect()` whose message explained *why* it failed, carry that reason into a `thiserror` variant rather than dropping it into a bare `?` or a stringly error. `unwrap()` and `expect()` are fine in tests.
- Follow the [NewType](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/generics/new_types.html) idiom — avoid bare Strings or f32s
  - When creating a NewType in Rust that is parsed from a `String`, implement the `FromStr` trait, which returns `Result<Self, Self::Err>` where Err is an associated error type you define. 
  - Additionally, provide a `pub fn new(s: impl Into<String>) -> Result<Self, YourError>` constructor for ergonomic direct construction, and have your `FromStr` implementation delegate to `new()`.
  - `FromStr + .parse()` is the Rust community standard for "string → validated domain type" conversions.
- Use typed representations instead of untyped arrays (e.g. `DynamicImage` not `Vec<u8>` for images)
- Arguments convey meaning through types (`C-CUSTOM-TYPE`) — don't take a bare `bool` or `Option` parameter whose meaning is opaque at the call site (`f(true, false)`); use a two-variant enum (`Overwrite::Yes`/`No`). This is the argument-side mirror of "never return `bool` for success" below.
- Eagerly derive common traits (`C-COMMON-TRAITS`, `C-DEBUG`) — `Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Eq, Hash, Default` wherever they apply, and every public type implements `Debug`.
- Represent missing/not-set/disabled data that is expected and valid with `Option<T>` (`None`) — never with sentinel values like `0`, `-1`, or empty strings to encode absence. Use `Result::Err` when the absence instead represents an invalid state the caller should propagate with `?`
- Errors (`C-GOOD-ERR`): structured [thiserror](https://docs.rs/thiserror/latest/thiserror/) enums for library/domain code, where callers match on outcomes. At a binary's `main`/orchestration layer a type-erased error (`Box<dyn std::error::Error>`) is acceptable — nobody matches on it, a human reads it.
  - Functions that can fail must return `Result<T, E>`, never `bool` for success/failure
  - Enums used as return types must only contain success variants; failure cases belong in the `Err` side of a `Result`. For example, a `verify()` function should return `Result<VerifyResult, E>` where `VerifyResult` has `Match`/`NotFound`/`Mismatch` (all valid outcomes) — not a `Failed` variant baked into the enum
- Module structure: different kinds of things (schemas, layers) belong in their own module with their own tests
- We should aim to keep `lib.rs` files below 300 lines (found via a command like `find . -name "lib.rs" | grep -v "target" | xargs wc -l`). Any `lib.rs` file going above this limit should trigger us to apply other rules, for example related to extracting modules, that will allow us to split into into logical chunks.
- Cross-crate models go in a `shared` crate's `lib.rs`
- **Import a type directly from the crate that owns it; don't re-export it through an intermediary to keep an old path alive.** When a type's home is `shared` (or any crate), consumers write `use shared::Foo` directly. Do **not** add a `pub use shared::Foo` to some middle crate just so an existing `middle_crate::Foo` import keeps compiling — that hides where the type really lives and couples consumers to the wrong crate. We control every crate in this workspace, so it is fine (and preferred) to break an internal cross-crate import path when a type moves to its proper home: update the call sites to import from the new owner in the same change. A re-export is only justified when it is a deliberate, documented part of *that* crate's own public API — never as a compatibility shim.
- Keep shared/library types as pure data types — don't add policy or business-logic methods to them. Policy logic belongs in the crate that owns the decision. Only inherent behaviour (formatting, parsing, construction) belongs on the type itself.
- Testing:
  - Run tests with `cargo nextest run` (via `just test` / `just test-no-docker`), not `cargo test`
  - Tests needing Docker (e.g. testcontainers) get a `_docker`-suffixed name so the `no-docker` nextest profile skips them; `just test-no-docker` is the sandbox-safe run
  - Core functionality gets inline unit tests
  - Multi-part integration gets integ tests (use captured real data)
  - Prefer high-level invariant-based tests over bespoke examples; use [proptest](https://docs.rs/proptest/latest/proptest/) for property-based tests
  - Integration tests must use real application types (e.g. `App`, `Project` impls), not test-only duplicates
  - Integration tests should exercise the public HTTP interface for both setup and assertions — avoid calling store/service methods directly as back-doors when an HTTP endpoint exists for the same operation
- Binary layout:
  - All binaries must be named files in `src/bin/` (e.g. `src/bin/finder.rs`), never `src/main.rs` or subdirectories like `src/bin/finder/main.rs`
  - Modules used by binaries live under `src/` and are exposed through `lib.rs`, not placed alongside binaries in `src/bin/`
- **Identity-keyed maps over positionally-aligned `Vec`s for parallel/async work.** When a function takes `&[Input]` and produces one output per input, return `HashMap<Id, Output>` keyed by something derived from the input — not a `Vec<Output>` that callers zip by index. Positional alignment depends on the implementation preserving order: `futures::Stream::buffered` does today, `buffer_unordered` does not, and a `par_iter` or task-pool scheduler may not either. A future switch silently desyncs each output from its input, the bug is invisible at the call site (`scored[i]` looks correct), and only manifests as wrong downstream results. Look up by id at the call site instead — making mismatched positions structurally impossible.
- Keep feature enablement flags (e.g. `--use-redis`) separate from their configuration values (e.g. `--redis-url`). A feature's on/off switch should not be derived from whether its config happens to be present — these are independent concerns.
- **Prefer functions over macros — reach for `macro_rules!` only when you genuinely need syntax or control flow a function can't express, and the duplication it removes is actually painful.** A macro being *able* to dedup something is not reason enough. Removing repetition is not, on its own, a justification: accepting a few lines of straightforward duplication (e.g. two `tracing` calls that differ only by level and message) is almost always better than a `macro_rules!` that a reader has to mentally expand. Macros cost more than they look — worse error messages, no go-to-definition, awkward to read and refactor — so the bar is "a function provably can't do this *and* the duplication is genuinely costly", not "this is slightly repetitive".
- **Avoid `continue`.** It makes control flow indirect — the conditions for skipping live separately from the body of the loop. Prefer:
  - `Iterator::filter_map` / `filter` / `?` inside a closure for skip-on-condition patterns
  - Extract the inner body into a helper function that returns `Option<T>` and use `filter_map` over it
  - `if let Some(x) = ... { ... }` for guarded execution
  - Restructure so the loop body has a single straight-line path
- Prefer simple, readable techniques over clever ones until profiling identifies a real hotspot.
  - When the borrow checker pushes back, reach for `.clone()` first. Only escalate to tricks like `std::mem::take`, manual index loops, `RefCell`, or restructuring fields once a benchmark or trace shows the clone matters.
  - Example: in a per-tick loop that needs `&mut self` access while iterating one field, `let xs = self.xs.clone(); for x in xs { self.do_something(&x); }` beats `for x in std::mem::take(&mut self.xs) { ... }`. Both work; the clone is one line, obvious to read, and ~free for small Vecs of small values. Save the cleverness for when it's earned.
