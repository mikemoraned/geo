# Finding city boundaries

Looking at overturemaps, which is likely just inheriting this structure, 
a 'city' can be different subtypes of "division_area". For example, "Amsterdam" is a
"locality" whereas "Edinburgh" is "county".

Hmm, though "Amsterdam" appears multiple times, and also in different types? (county and locality)
