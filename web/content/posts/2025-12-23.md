You can see the [notebook](/notebooks/makers-gonna-make/2025-09/tube.html) for the outcome. 

Overall my first impressions are good! It forces you to do things like define variables once, and will automatically run dependent cells. Extra super-nice things are built-in integrations with `uv` and a very clean format for seeing diffs; the save format is essentially 'just python'. Definitely something I'll be using from now on if I can.
