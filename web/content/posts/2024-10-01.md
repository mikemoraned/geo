I did a talk on this project at the [GeoMOB Edinburgh event on 1/10/2024](https://thegeomob.com/post/oct-1st-2024-geomobedi-details). 
The [slides](/slides/2024_Geomob_Oct_Presentation.pdf) are available, but I'll give a summary of the accompanying explanation content here.

The "Biscuits" project began back in [September 2017](https://github.com/mikemoraned/biscuits?tab=readme-ov-file#september-2017). 
It was inspired by a work of art by [Armelle Caron](https://www.armellecaron.fr) 
called [Les Villes Rangees](https://www.armellecaron.fr/works/les-villes-rangees/):

I wondered if I could automatically "destruct" and lay out the sections in a similar way. So began a side-project I've been working on, 
off-and-on, for 7 years. The original Github project gives [a bit more detailed history](https://github.com/mikemoraned/biscuits?tab=readme-ov-file#biscuits), 
but the major iterations were:

Obviously we then had COVID happen in 2020, which was distracting to say the least. However, the biggest issue was
that I discovered doing things *entirely* in the browser at pixel level was not very robust. There were various techniques I could 
have applied, like a separate off-screen canvas for calculations. That would require a lot of testing to get right and make work.

It felt though that this was going against-the-grain and, more generally, I was really just reluctant to go learn about how
OpenstreetMap and Geo API's / libraries work.

Between then and now that's effectively what I've done, or at least enough to recreate where I got to in Speculaas, albeit entirely off-line.

The current version, which I got ready for the GeoMOB presentation, is pretty simple at the high-level:

{% mermaid() %}
flowchart LR
    b(Boundaries) --> r(Regions) --> l(Layout)
{% end %}

<div class="columns">
    <div class="column">
        <div class="card">
            <header class="card-header">
                <p class="card-header-title">Boundaries</p>
            </header>
            <div class="card-image">
                {{ image(src='/images/boundaries.png',size='5by3') }}
            </div>
            <div class="card-content">
                <div class="content is-size-6">
This is where the Map data enters. We want to get to a binary version of an area where 
"black" = part we want to keep and "white" = a border of some kind.


I'll not go into detail here but this image was derived by sampling and overlapping routes across 
Edinburgh from [Stadia Maps](https://stadiamaps.com).

The area is defined in terms of pixels and not geo coordinates. This is partly because I find it easier to do, but also because it gives me most freedom to mix-and-match sources. So, for example, whilst I've not done it yet it in this version, adding an exclusion area for water is as simple as finding a source and drawing it as white pixels.

The actual Regions are found by applying a [Boundary Tracing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_tracing) algorithm at the pixel level.

To get back to Geo-land I re-interpret the boundaries that have been derived into geo <code>Polygons</code>.

It's these pixel-processing stages that leads to the low-level blockiness in the shapes.
</p>
<p>
I can <em>probably</em> make a future version of this pure-geo by doing something like:
<ol>
<li>Take all input <code>Geometry</code> which defines the border areas.</li>
<li>Union them together.</li>
<li>Define an area border (e.g. a city's limits) as a <code>Polygon</code> and takeaway (difference) the unioned border areas.
<li>What remains should be the Regions</li>
</ol>

However, the pixel-level version I have works for now. As long as I wrap it behind a <code>trait</code> I can replace it later.

There are lots of different ways layout could be done. For this iteration, as in Speculaas, I treat this as [2d bin-packing](https://www.csc.liv.ac.uk/~epa/surveyhtml.html) problem.

This particular example here shows a layout based on a [Guillotine](https://okanplusz.wordpress.com/2016/07/07/bin-packing/) algorithm.

What's next? Well, first a scorecard on [this implementation, which I've christened "Linzer"](https://github.com/mikemoraned/geo/tree/main/apps/linzer):
* ðŸ˜€ pedestrian and auto-biased route sources
* ðŸ˜€ deterministic
* ðŸ˜€ bin-packing auto-layout

After this, there are a lot of things I could do next to improve it. Some of these I've done before in different iterations, and some are totally new:

* boundaries:
    * roads, paths
    * clip by city boundary
    * mask-out water bodies
* regions:
    * green areas
    * rotate to minimal bbox
* layout:
    * layout as text glyphs
* display:
    * animated placement

However, since this is more of an Art Project than a technical one, I reserve the right to "honour my whimsy" and do something totally different.
