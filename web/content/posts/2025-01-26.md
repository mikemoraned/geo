It was great to get along to my second ["Makers gonna make"][mgm_jan] event at Codebase on Saturday, despite the Red Weather Warning on Friday. Many thanks to [Peter Trizuliak](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-trizuliak/) for organising.

It's a pretty laid-back environment with a nice mix of focus time, breaks for pizza and free coffee / food (thanks to sponsors, [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/uk), [Codebase](https://thisiscodebase.com) and [The Source Coffee roasters](https://www.thesourcecoffee.co.uk/brewd)). You can present what you've done and/or head to pub later, but no pressure to do either. The [next event is coming up in February](https://lu.ma/c410sjxy); I unfortunately can't make this one, but maybe see you at another!

I worked on some extensions and performance tweaks to make my [Linzer](https://linzer.houseofmoran.io) app work with multiple cities (see [previous blog post](@/posts/2025-01-07.md) for some context). I mainly did this to continue providing examples that the Region "Signatures" made sense. Given unrelated stuff I need to work on in Q1 2025, it'll be a while before I have something meaningfully that uses them but it's good to see them making sense so far.

Thanks to all the attendees for feedback, including links to the very interesting-looking [Creating with Data](https://creatingwithdata.com) (subscribed!).
